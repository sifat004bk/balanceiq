< 
< ## Document Philosophy
< 
< These documents are:
< - **Concise**: Only essential information
< - **Practical**: Real code examples and actionable guidance
< - **Current**: Reflects actual codebase state
< - **Focused**: For developers and AI agents, not business stakeholders
< 
< ## Contributing
< 
< When updating these docs:
< 1. Keep them short and actionable
< 2. Use code examples from actual codebase
< 3. Update IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md when features change
< 4. Add new tasks to TASKS.md

< 
< ## Recent Updates (2025-11-22)
< 
< **API Integration Sprint Completed:**
< - ✅ Implemented 6 authentication backend APIs (signup, login, profile, password management)
< - ✅ Added chat history API with pagination
< - ✅ Created 22 comprehensive integration tests
< - ✅ Organized documentation structure under projectcontext/
< - 🔴 **Critical**: UI layer not yet synced with new backend APIs (see [implementation/UI_LAYER_EVALUATION.md](implementation/UI_LAYER_EVALUATION.md))
< 
< **Documentation Reorganized:**
< - All API implementation docs → `implementation/`
< - All design specifications → `design_docs/`
< - Progress tracking → `progress/`
< - See directory READMEs for details
