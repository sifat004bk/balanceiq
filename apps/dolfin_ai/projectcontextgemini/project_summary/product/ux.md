# BalanceIQ UX Principles (Bangladesh First)

This document outlines the core principles and guidelines for the BalanceIQ user experience,
tailored for the Bangladesh market. Our goal is to create a product that is not only functional but
also delightful and trustworthy for users in a cash and mobile-money economy.

## 1. Core UX Principles

* **Effortless & Intuitive:** This is our most important principle. The app must feel easier and
  faster than opening a notebook or Excel. We will achieve this through a world-class, chat-based
  entry system that understands natural language in both Bangla and English. Every interaction
  should reduce cognitive load.

* **Insightful & Actionable:** We are a financial guide, not just a ledger. The app must provide
  clear, simple, and actionable insights based on the user's manually entered data. Data
  visualizations should be beautiful and easy to understand, highlighting what's most important to a
  user in the Bangladeshi context.

* **Trustworthy & Private:** Financial data is sensitive. Since we are not asking for bank
  credentials, our trust is built on privacy and user control. The design must convey that the user
  is always in command of their data. We will be transparent and prioritize the security of the data
  they manually provide.

* **Localized & Empowering:** The app must feel like it was made *for* Bangladesh. This means
  understanding local financial behaviors (bKash, Nagad), language (Bangla/English code-switching),
  and goals. We will empower users by giving them a clear picture of their finances, helping them
  feel in control of their money for the first time.

## 2. User Journey Map (High-Level)

1. **Onboarding & The "Aha!" Moment:**
    * Simple sign-up (Email/Password).
    * Clear value proposition: "Track your spending as easily as sending a WhatsApp message."
    * **Guided first-use tutorial:** The app immediately prompts the user to log their first expense
      in the chat interface.
    * **The "Aha!" Moment:** The user types "Rickshaw 50 taka," sees the AI understand it, and
      watches it appear instantly on the dashboard. This entire flow should take less than 30
      seconds.

2. **Regular Use (The "Loop"):**
    * **Log:** Throughout the day, the user quickly logs expenses via chat, voice, or photo as they
      happen. This is the core habit.
    * **Review:** The user opens the app to the dashboard to get a quick overview of their financial
      health (balances in Cash/bKash, recent spending).
    * **Explore:** The user dives deeper into spending analysis or budgets to understand their
      patterns.
    * **Act:** Based on insights from the app (e.g., "You are close to your 'Dining Out' budget"),
      the user makes a decision. The app's feedback loop reinforces positive financial habits.

3. **Goal Achievement:**
    * User sets a financial goal (e.g., "Save for a new phone").
    * The app helps the user create a plan and track their progress with each manually logged
      saving.
    * The app celebrates milestones, reinforcing the value of tracking.

## 3. The Dashboard-First Experience

The dashboard is the heart of the BalanceIQ experience. It is the first thing the user sees and must
provide immediate value derived from their manual entries.

* **Key Components:**
    * **Account Balances:** A prominent view of the user's manually managed accounts (e.g., Cash,
      bKash, Nagad, Bank).
    * **Recent Transactions:** A feed of the latest manually logged transactions for quick review.
    * **Spending Snapshot:** A simple chart showing spending by top categories for the current
      month.
    * **Budget Health:** A quick-glance indicator of how the user is tracking against their budgets.
    * **AI Insight Card:** A card featuring a single, timely insight based on the user's entries (
      e.g., "You've spent 80% of your 'Transport' budget.").

* **Interaction:** The dashboard is a launchpad. Tapping any module takes the user to a detailed
  view. Crucially, it should also have a prominent, always-accessible button to open the chat and
  log a new expense, reinforcing the core loop.

## 4. Onboarding Experience

The goal of onboarding is to get the user to the "Aha!" moment of effortless manual logging as
quickly as possible.

* **Flow:**
    1. Welcome screens (max 3) highlighting the core benefits: "Track bKash & cash in seconds," "
       Understand your spending with AI," "Finally, a finance app for Bangladesh."
    2. Simple email and password sign-up.
    3. **Immediate guided action:** Instead of asking to connect a bank, the app opens the chat
       interface with a tooltip: **"Let's log your first expense. Try typing 'Coffee 30 taka'."**
    4. As the user types, the AI responds, confirms the entry, and a visual cue directs them to the
       dashboard.
    5. Land the user on the dashboard, now populated with their very first entry.
    6. Use a subtle tooltip to point out how the dashboard updated, closing the loop and
       demonstrating the core value instantly.
