# BalanceIQ Product Plan (Bangladesh First)

## 1. Vision

To be the most intuitive and empowering financial wellness companion for Bangladesh, helping users
effortlessly track their cash and mobile money transactions to achieve their financial goals with
confidence.

## 2. Mission

Our mission is to solve the unique financial tracking challenges of a cash-and-mobile-money economy.
We provide a simple, chat-based AI tool that makes logging expenses in Bangla and English as easy as
sending a text message, bringing clarity and control to millions of Bangladeshis.

## 3. Target Audience

### Primary: The Urban Bangladeshi Professional

* **Demographics:** 25-40 years old, salaried professionals or small business owners living in urban
  centers like Dhaka, Chattogram, and Sylhet. Earning 40,000-100,000 BDT/month.
* **Psychographics:** Tech-savvy and mobile-first, using smartphones (Android majority) and mobile
  money (bKash, Nagad) daily. They aspire to save and build a strong financial future but lose track
  of where their money goes mid-month. They are comfortable with apps but find traditional,
  Western-focused finance apps irrelevant.
* **Needs:** A simple, reliable way to track a mix of cash, bKash, and Nagad transactions. They need
  a tool that understands their local context and language, without the complexity of bank
  integrations which are largely irrelevant to their daily financial lives.

### Secondary: Young Professionals & Students

* **Demographics:** 22-30 years old, earning 20,000-50,000 BDT/month.
* **Needs:** A tool to stretch their budget and build good financial habits early. They are early
  adopters and will be key to driving organic, word-of-mouth growth.

## 4. Product Strategy

Our strategy is to build a "chat-first" experience where manual transaction entry is the core,
celebrated feature. We will win the Bangladesh market by building a product that is purpose-built
for its economic realities, language, and user behaviors.

**Core Principles:**

1. **Manual-Entry is the Feature:** We will build the world's best manual entry experience via chat,
   voice, and photo OCR. We will not build bank integration for the initial market.
2. **Bangladesh-First:** The product will be designed for Bangladesh from the ground up, with deep
   contextual understanding of local financial products (bKash, Nagad), language (Bangla/English),
   and culture.
3. **Simplicity Over Complexity:** We will compete against Excel and notebooks, not feature-bloated
   Western apps. The core loop of "log, categorize, review" must be effortless.

### Go-to-Market Strategy:

1. **Phase 1: Bangladesh MVP Launch:** Launch a Freemium SaaS model in Bangladesh. The free tier
   will be robust enough to build habit, while the premium tier will offer advanced AI insights,
   automation, and power-user features.
2. **Phase 2: Growth & Dominance in Bangladesh:** Use a low-CAC acquisition strategy focused on
   social media, local influencers, and community-driven viral growth to become the #1 expense
   tracker in the country.
3. **Phase 3: Regional Expansion:** After achieving profitability and market leadership in
   Bangladesh, adapt the model for similar cash-and-mobile-money economies like Pakistan, Sri Lanka,
   and Nepal.

## 5. Success Metrics (KPIs)

We will focus on the 5 key metrics that measure the health and viability of our strategy in the
Bangladesh market.

* **Day 30 Retention Rate:** Measures if users are building a habit. **Target: >30%**
* **Free-to-Paid Conversion Rate:** Measures if the premium value proposition is strong enough. *
  *Target: 10-15%**
* **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** Measures the efficiency of our marketing. **Target: <400 BDT
  **
* **Monthly Active Users (MAU) Growth:** Measures product-market fit and momentum. **Target: 20-30%
  MoM**
* **Avg. Expenses Logged Per User Per Month:** Measures core engagement. **Target: >15**
